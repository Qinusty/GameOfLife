# GameOfLife
My python implementation of John Conway's 'Game of life'.
The UI is implemented using pygame and thus is a requirement for the game.

## Controls
- **Space** Toggles pause mode where you can draw on the grid.
- **C** Clears the grid.
- **S** Saves the current state of the grid into a clipboard style variable. (single save at one time)
- **L** Loads the current state of the grid from the save variable.
- **LeftClick** In pause mode this allows you to draw on the grid.
- **RightClick** In pause mode this allows you to 'rub out' on the grid.
 
Written and tested on Python version 3.4
